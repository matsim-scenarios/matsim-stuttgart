# The MATSim (Open) Stuttgart Scenario

### About this project

This repository provides a partly open MATSim transport model for Stuttgart, provided by the [Transport Systems Planning and Transport Telematics group](https://www.vsp.tu-berlin.de) of [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de).


> Currently the model is work in progress and no release version is available.

They often, but not always, have a header pointing to matsim.org. They typically reside in the `scenarios` directory hierarchy. MATSim output files, analysis data, and visualizations are files generated by MATSim runs, or by postprocessing.  They typically reside in a directory hierarchy starting with `output`.

**Other data files**, in particular in `original-input-data`, have their own individual licenses that need to be individually clarified with the copyright holders.

### Note

Handling of large files within git is not without problems (git lfs files are not included in the zip download; we have to pay; ...).  In consequence, large files, both on the input and on the output side, reside at https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/countries/de/stuttgart .
